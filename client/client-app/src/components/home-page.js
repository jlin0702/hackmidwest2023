          <p className="homepage-p">Our team had to overcome many challenges over the course of the hackathon. Before this hackathon, none of us had ever worked with NFTs before. During the hackathon, we learned about how NFT, the BlockChain, Ethereum, and NFT protocols work. This was the first time at HackMidwest for 2 of our members. One of our members was completely new to the team. And one of our planned teammates canceled on the hackathon the morning of. Yet, we finished the hackathon victorious with a finished product and many new skills!</p>

I have never worked with React before and I had absolutely no knowledge about NFTs, blockchain, or anything like that. But by the end of this hackathon, I had minted my own NFTs, own my own blockchain wallet, used pinata to store files for NFTs, own ethereum, and traded NFTs!</p>
